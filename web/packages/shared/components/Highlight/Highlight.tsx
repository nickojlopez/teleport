 * Highlight wraps the keywords found in the text in <mark> tags.

 * It is a simplified version of the component provided by the react-highlight-words package.
 * It can be extended with the features provided by highlight-words-core (e.g. case sensitivity).
 *
 * It doesn't handle Unicode super well because highlight-words-core uses a regex with the i flag
 * underneath. This means that the component will not always ignore differences in case, for example
 * when matching a string with the Turkish Ä°.
